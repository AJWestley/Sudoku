# Sudoku
A sudoku game I made

I am terrible at art, so I made the game in a doodle-like art style so that my bad drawing would fit in. 
It's a pretty basic sudoku game which randomly generates a puzzle based on difficulty you select.
I added a hint button in case the player is ever stuck and a timer so they can see how well they do by the end.
